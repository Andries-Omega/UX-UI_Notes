# User Experience (UX) Design
## UX and UI
UX is the intersection between business, people and technology

It finds itself balancing
- technical feasibility
- business viability and
- the VALUE / DESIRABILITY  to the user or customer.
<br/><br/>

## Always avoid functional, but unausable (There should be a balance).
<br/>

## Avoid BAD  UI: Confusing and counter-invalue (Users Need To Understand In order for your product to provide value).
<br/>

## Feedback when using something is very important (Users will most likely press the button more than once, if there is no indication that their initial push was successfull).
<br/>

## You should not think too hard to know how to make use of something(make the use obvious).
<br/>

## Go for things that are intuitive (You know your UI is terrible if users have to think hard in order to know what is going on).
<br/>


## There is a hierachy of user needs

### The hierachy:
1. Meaningful: Has personal significance
2. Pleasurable:  memorable experience worth sharing
3. Convenient: Easy to use, Works like we think
4. Usable: Cam be used wothout difficulty
5. Reliable: Is available and accurate
6. Functional: works as it should.

## Design principles (they make a great user expirience)
1. Visibility: What are you showing people once they get on first page, Is this what you want them to see? Is what the whole platform is about.
2. Discoverability: Make sure users don't work hard to know what they can do
3. Know what you want to grab the users attention the most.
4. Feedback: Let users know what is going on (If they press a button, show them their press is registered)
5. Unclear errors: Make sure you tell users what the error is all about.
6. Constraints: Do not allow people to do what they are not supposed to do (eg = no negative dates).
7. Contrast: Make sure the text is clear in its background, goal = make sure what you want users to see, they can see.
8. Mapping: Make sure what users think they're seeing, is exactly what they are seeing. 
9. Consistency: Ensure there are patterns on what you are doing, Limit how different things should be (make sure button design are consistent).
10. Affordance: How to tell people how to do things.


## What is the future of UX Design
1. Smart Surfaces
2. Voice Interfaces: You should be able to ask it anything in any format
3. Virtual Reality: 
4. Augmented Reality
5. Brain Interfaces
6. CX design = Customer expirience.
7. Hyper Personalisation: Making product farmilier to the user depending on their previous expirience (E.g = Netflix)


## Human-Centered design
- Look at how people want to use something, and don't force them into using it the way you think they should use it.

## Sometimes people can be unsmart
- So always try to think of ways people can misread your product.
- Idea = make it foolproof.

### It does not matter what you think it should be, What matters is what people who will use it think it should be.
